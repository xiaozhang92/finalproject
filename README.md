# Documentation for your project in the form of a Markdown file called README.md. This documentation is to be a userâ€™s manual for your
# project. Though the structure of your documentation is entirely up to you, it should be incredibly clear to the staff how and where,
# if applicable, to compile, configure, and use your project. Your documentation should be at least several paragraphs in length. It
# should not be necessary for us to contact you with questions regarding your project after its submission. Hold our hand with this
# documentation; be sure to answer in your documentation any questions that you think we might have while testing your work.
