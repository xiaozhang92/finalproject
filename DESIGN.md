## Aparkment



# WHAT

A website that lets a developer or investor find and estimate the total value of residential units transformed from parking
facilities in Manhattan, New York City.


# WHY

Auto-drive technologies are no longer just a concept exists in a fiction or a futuristic movie. Autonomous vehicles are in fact
under development and experiments among many auto makers and big data collector companies. Alongside with the maturation of
ride-sharing and share economy, the ownership of the autonomous vehicles become less desirable and economical. The urban structure
that we have right now is expected to be re-examined and transformed into a more efficient and intelligent environment. Many
researchers started to tackle the parking problem. Automation not only allows cars to park themselves, but also enables the cars to
park more precisely so require way more compact parking spaces. What will happen to the existing parking structure? Can we give them
new purposes?

There once was a trend of turning warehouses and factories into living units, called "Loft Apartments". The uniqueness and low cost
of such typology gave a certain group of people a new and more affordable option of choosing what environment they want to live in.
Similarly, if the leftover parking facilities could turned into living units, these structures might gain new values and generate
benefits for developers and services for new residents. We propose that the transformation of the parking facilities into a new
living typology.


# HOW

We collected a database of all existing parking facilities in Manhattan, which will be accessible through addresses. Once a parking
facility is selected, the total building area will be called out or calculated to incorporate the desired different percentages of
unit types that were inputted through the website, to generate the actual numbers of each unit types could be transformed from the
building. An average unit price for this area (referencing Trulia.com) would be pulled out to calculate the total value the inputted
combination of unit types. Having an account on the website would allow you to review a history of your searches and inputs at
anytime.


# WISH

We wish to hint to the world the possibility of reusing existing resources and turning it into a potential new trend of social
behavior, so the owners, developers, residents, the existing structures and the environment could call be beneficial and adapt to the
new changes brought to society.
